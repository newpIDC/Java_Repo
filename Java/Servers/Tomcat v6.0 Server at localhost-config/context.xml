<!-- The contents of this file will be loaded for each web application --><!-- Marty Hall: Changed <Context> to 
     <Context reloadable="true" privileged="true">.
     The reloadable part enables servlet reloading, so
     that WEB-INF/classes and WEB-INF/lib are monitored for changes.
     This lets you redeploy .class files or .jar files without restarting
     Tomcat. The privileged part lets you run the invoker servlet.
     Both are useful during application development, but servlet reloading
     slows things down for deployed apps, and the invoker servlet
     is bad style and can open security holes for deployed apps. 
     Disable both for deployment environments!
     
     This and the other changes for app
     development (not deployment!) are discussed in
     http://www.coreservlets.com/Apache-Tomcat-Tutorial/.
